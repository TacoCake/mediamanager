# Guide to format your files in the event they incorrectly parse.

When you have a downloaded show that isn't being correctly parsed or identified, please refer to this guide.

## Alias & Abridged names
>if your mislabeled show has both of these, ignore this step

Most times when a show isn't being correctly identified it's because the show doesn't have an **abridged** name or an **alias**. The 'name' value is set automatically by the program, and by default the **abridged** and **alias** are the same as the **name**.
For exemple,

---
The show 'Is it wrong to pick-up girls in a dungeon?' has both an **abridged** name and an **alias**.
>**Alias**: Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka      *(The japanese version of the name)*

>**Abridged**: Dan-machi       *(The shortened version of the japanese name, easier for googling)*

>**note if the english name is the 'name', like in this exemple, then the alias will be the japanese name, and vice-versa**
---

Without setting these extra bits of information, the program can't possibly know if a file belongs to a certain show, since it doesn't have the same **name**.

**To add or change these bits of information** just click on the show card (**the one with the correct name**) then click on the '**Edit**' button, and change the respective information using the text boxes.
>Information changes will save once you change pages.

Please follow the rest of the guide **until the very last step to ensure the best use of the program**
