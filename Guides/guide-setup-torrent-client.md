# Guide to setting up a torrent client.


## Note this guide is UNFINISHED



### 1. Downloading & Choosing the right client

First of all, there are many, many, **MANY** torrent clients (For exemple: UTorrent, Bittorrent, Deluge, etc), but not all torrent clients have the same features. Some of them have ads and track your downloads.
_Personaly_ I use [qbittorent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) which is an open-source torrent-client without any ads. **_More importantly_**, it gives you the option to **encrypt** the torrenting traffic.

### 2. Enabling Encryption (and the use)

Before we enable encryption you might want to know what it actually does. Well first you need to understand that there is both encrypted and unencrypted torrenting traffic.

*Unecrypted traffic* is less common than encrypted traffic since it's safer to use encryption over nothing at all. However, by default, most torrenting client allow it by default.

*Encrypted traffic* basically hides the current data that you are torrenting from anyone looking in on your internet traffic. (I.E. Your ISP)
>**Important note: however, anyone _inside_ the peers list, can easily see your IP in the peers list. 
>Which is why it is recommended to get a VPN for torrenting.**
