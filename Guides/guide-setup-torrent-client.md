# Guide to setting up a torrenting client.
## Note this guide is UNFINISHED
### 1. Downloading the client
First of all, there are many, many, **MANY** torrent clients (For exemple: UTorrent, Bittorrent, Deluge, etc), but not all torrent clients have the same features. Some of them have ads and track your downloads.
Personaly I use [qbittorent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) which is an open-source torrent-client without any ads. More importantly, it gives you the option to **encrypt** the torrenting traffic.
